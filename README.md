# Weather-Dashboard

# Description

This project allows the user to look up current and future weather forecasts in a city of their choice. This project uses the Open Weather API, which links the weather data to the page. 

The user is able to search for a city of their choice in the search-bar. Once a city is selected, the current weather will display in the main section of the page. The data visible to the user will be the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the uv index along with a supporting image (sun/clouds/rain,etc). The user is also presented with a five-day forecast breakdown at the bottom of the page which provides them with similar pieces of data for the upcoming days. 


This project is my first project which uses an API. I was challenged with operating the API and figuring out how to extract specific data points and match them with elements in my html. This was a huge learning experience but I believe that I can make better projects in the future because of the skills I learned.
